## Getting Started

To help you get started, an example is provided to demonstrate how to run the tool and to show output results format.

### Example Usage

In this example, we run the tool over a region of chromosome 6 (from position 149,721,689 to 149,772,647) using the Pangenome samples (VCF file). The VCF file can be found in the `data` folder, or it can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10612073).

### Running the Example

To execute the example, run the provided shell script:

```bash
sh runExample.sh
```

Upon successful execution, the output file chr6_149721689_149772647.tsv will be generated.
